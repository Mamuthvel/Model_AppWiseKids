Build a responsive, secure web application named AppWiseKids Dashboard – a platform designed for parents to monitor and manage their child's mobile app usage and screen time.
The platform should integrate the concept of AppWise Smart Badges for app safety ratings and provide real-time alerts for risky app behavior.

🔑 Core Features:

Separate roles: Parent and Child (connected device).

Real-time notifications (mocked) when:

A new app is installed.

Screen time exceeds preset limits.

A flagged app (red or “High Risk” badge) is detected.

Every app entry must display a badge:

🟡 Yellow – Moderate caution.

🔴 Red – High risk or inappropriate.

Badges come with short expert review summaries.
